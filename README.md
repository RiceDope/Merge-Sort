# Merge Sort

This is an implementation of merge sort. It is valid for an ArrayList<Integer> and only containing integers.

```Java
// create the MergeSort object
MergeSort merge = new MergeSort();

// we already have an array in this example
ArrayList<Integer> sorted = merge.mergeSort(myArray);
```
